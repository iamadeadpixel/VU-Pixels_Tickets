# Based on a mod from IllustrisJack's
## VU-Pixels_Tickets
# V1.0.6
- Increased player count config up to 128 players

- Basicly procon can almost go retired.
- Crude setup, but it works.
- A nicer code is work in progress (i hope)
- Have fun setting the things u want.
- Edit the ticket_loader_Config.lua file
- Here are all tickets defined
- This is my current init setup

- This version has 7 playercount check.
- 1: 0 to 4 players
- 2: 5 to 12 players
- 3: 13 to 24 players
- 4: 25 to 32 players
- 5: 33 to 48 players
- 6: 49 to 64 players
- 7: 65 to 128 players


- There some tweaks for vehicle use
- i think they are pretty usefull, but you can adjust it.

# Disclaimer
- 1: Do not run any mod or procon plugin that also can change tickers/flags
- 2: Do not manualy adjust the ticket/flag ration, this mod wil overwrite it anyways.
- 3: Break it, mod it, tweak it.
- 4: Keku's Map mod is not yet suported for ticket switch.
