- This version has 7 playercount check.
- 1: 0 to 4 players
- 2: 5 to 12 players

- There some tweaks for vehicle use
- i think they are pretty usefull, but you can adjust it.

# Disclaimer
- 1: Do not run any mod or procon plugin that also can change tickers/flags
- 2: Do not manualy adjust the ticket/flag ration, this mod wil overwrite it anyways.
- 3: Break it, mod it, tweak it.
- 4: Bflag mod: Work in progress
- 5: Known isue on keku's maps: Fixed ticket rate, this is a nice WIP to do..
