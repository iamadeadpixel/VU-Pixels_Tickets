# Based on a mod from IllustrisJack's
## VU-Pixels_Tickets
- Basicly procon can almost go retired.
- Crude setup, but it works.
- A nicer code is work in progress (i hope)
- Have fun setting the things u want.
- Edit the ticket_loader_Config.lua file
- Here are all tickets defined
- This is my current init setup

- This version has 3 playercount check.
- 1: 0 to 4 players
- 2: 5 to 10 players
- 3: 11 to 20 players
- this is just a initsetup for the player count

- Each config contains its own ticket count
- and wil be loaded on map change.
- this includes also the playercount.

- There some tweaks for vehicle use
- i think they are pretty usefull, but you can adjust it.

# Disclaimer
- 1: Do not run any mod or procon plugin that also can change tickers/flags
- 2: Do not manualy adjust the ticket/flag ration, this mod wil overwrite it anyways.
- 3: Break it, mod it, tweak it.
